Task: Replicate Integration Workflows Between Projects

Required Parameters:
- Source Project ID: 
- Target Project ID: 
- Authentication:
  - Email: 
  - Password: 

Steps:
1. Get source workflows using list_integration_flows_for_project tool
2. Create identical workflows in target project using the exact source configuration:
   - Use same connector IDs
   - Use same function IDs
   - Use same flow types
   - Only workflow IDs will be new (generated upon creation)

Workflow Sequence Rules:
1. For Sync Workflows:
   - First workflow uses SYNC_VICAI trigger (ID: 38)
   - Subsequent workflows use FLOW trigger (ID: 35) with previous workflow's new ID
   - Create in sequence:
     * Dimension workflow → SYNC_VICAI trigger (38)
     * Account workflow → FLOW trigger (35) + new Dimension workflow ID
     * Payment Term workflow → FLOW trigger (35) + new Account workflow ID
     * Vendor workflow → FLOW trigger (35) + new Payment Term workflow ID
     * etc.

2. For Insert Workflows (Invoice, Payment):
   - Use same trigger function as source workflow
   - No sequence dependencies needed

Important Notes:
1. Do not deploy the workflows
2. Maintain exact source configuration except for workflow IDs
3. Track new workflow IDs for proper sequencing
4. No need for additional tool calls beyond getting source workflows
